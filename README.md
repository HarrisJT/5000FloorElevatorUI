# 5000FloorElevatorUI
5000 Floor Elevator Controls User Interface: Imagined 5,000-story building and its elevator controls UI/UX. 

Eventually I plan to develop the prototype into reality using Angular (at least as the front end), and that's why I started this repo. 

A High-Fidelity (interactive) prototype is made in Figma, you can try it here:

Since it is a high-fidelity prototype with a lot of animated transitions, I've noticed it only works "smoothly" on my work PC with a crazy high-end Radeon Pro workstation graphics card. It still works on mobile or other machines, just not buttery smooth.

Or watch a video of the prototype on YouTube:
