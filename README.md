# Dev Plans
Eventually I plan to develop the prototype into reality using Angular (at least as the front end), and that's why I started this repo. 

# View Prototype (interactive)
I made a High-Fidelity (interactive) prototype in Figma, you can try it here: 
https://www.figma.com/proto/iczbAgh449JT7lhwDP8wkb/5000FloorElevatorUI.1?node-id=1%3A3&viewport=-5167%2C945%2C0.49883145093917847&scaling=contain 

Since it is a high-fidelity prototype with a lot of animated transitions, I've noticed it only works "smoothly" on my work PC with a high-end Radeon Pro card. It still works on mobile or other machines, but often VERY SLOWLY. Watch the videos, linked below, to see how it is designed to transition between.

# App Stub
After installing the new ng app (Angular 8), I saw I could enable the Ivy Rendering engine, which I think isn't fully supported until Angular 9. I wonder if it will make a difference on more graphics-intensive aplications like this UI?
