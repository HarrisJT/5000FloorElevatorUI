Eventually I plan to develop the prototype into reality using Angular (at least as the front end), and that's why I started this repo. 

I made a High-Fidelity (interactive) prototype in Figma, you can try it here: 
https://www.figma.com/proto/iczbAgh449JT7lhwDP8wkb/5000FloorElevatorUI.1?node-id=1%3A3&viewport=-5167%2C945%2C0.49883145093917847&scaling=contain 

Since it is a high-fidelity prototype with a lot of animated transitions, I've noticed it only works "smoothly" on my work PC with a high-end Radeon Pro card. It still works on mobile or other machines, but often VERY SLOWLY. Watch the videos, linked below, to see how it is designed to transition between.

After installing the new ng app (Angular 8), I saw I could enable the Ivy Rendering engine, which I think isn't fully supported until Angular 9. I wonder if it will make a difference on more graphics-intensive aplications like this UI?
